.fitgrd is the lightweight &amp; sexy looking responsive grid for your next awesome website.

Find the working demo here: www.fitgrd.com
It works in all modern Browsers and IE7 - IE10.



## What it is
.Fitgrd is not a framework. It's a solid foundation to build up your own responsive website. 
It is designed for rapid prototyping, but also runs well in production environments. 
This grid system is perfect for advanced web designers who don't want to have their pages look like "bootstraped". 
Everything but the grid is up to you and gives you the ability to save a lot of dispensable code. 
Give it a try and you'll love it.

## What you will get
.Fitgrd is divided into twelve columns with percentual widths. 
Each column has two percent of margin on both sides. I'm not a friend of heavy usage of media queries. 
So i included just two for the size of 36.5em(phones) and 48em(tablets). 
Write smart code and you will not need more.

## Note
Fitgrd is a product of much coffee and sleepless nights. 
I have many good ideas for further development which
will make your life easier as developer or designer.
